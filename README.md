# MDB Web Intro Exercises

Designed to build familiarity with HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Exercises are designed
to be mildly annoying, but should be able to be completed within 2 or 3 hours.
Expect to read through some documentation. If you get stuck, ask for help.

I recommend completing the exercise in the following order:

1) index.html
  - basic HTML exercises

2) about.html
  - more basic HTML Exercises

3) styles.css
  - CSS exercises

4) simulator.html
  - basic JavaScript exercises

5) simulator.js
  - more advanced JavaScript exercises
